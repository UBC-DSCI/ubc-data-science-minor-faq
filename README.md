*Formal approval for the Data Science Minor is pending. In anticipation of approval, we are moving forward with admissions at this time.*

I read that if the minor is oversubscribed, a randomization process will be used to select candidates. Will any of the criteria in this selection process be based on GPA? Is there anything I can do in my application to stand out?

> Thanks for your interest in the program. As long as you meet the minimum lower level requirements (listed on https://datascience.ubc.ca/minor), then you have the same chance getting into the minor as anyone else who meets those requirements. Our goal for the program is to make it accessible to all students who want to take the program and meet the admissions requirements. We may not be able to do this in the first couple of years of the program, due to resource limitations and program demand. If demand exceeds the spots we can make available (which are limited by our resources) that is when the randomization process will come into play. 

I haven’t taken any of the lower-level course requirements for admission to the Data Science minor yet. Can I still apply and be accepted, contingent my grades being above 68% in those courses once I take them? 

> Thanks for your interest in the Data Science minor. You must have taken the lower-level requirements, and achieved the minimum GPA (listed here: https://datascience.ubc.ca/minor) in them to meet the criteria for admission into the Data Science minor. If you don’t yet meet the criteria, we encourage you to apply next year.

I am in third year standing now, but will be in 4th year standing in September, am I eligible for admission to the minor?

> Thanks for your interest in the Data Science minor. I am sorry, but it is not open to students with 4th year standing in the fall of the year they apply. We had to have the line drawn somewhere. If I was able to, I would make this program available to all students, however we have the reality of resources limiting the number of students it can support. Have you considered applying for one of the UBC Master of Data Science programs for your next degree? We have three programs, you can learn more about them here: https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/

Can I use a different second year statistics course in place of STAT 201 as the pre-requisite for STAT 301?

> To obtain the Data Science minor, you will be required to take STAT 301, and STAT 201 is a hard prerequisite for it. Thus, you will need to take STAT 201 if you want to complete the minor. There is some overlap between STAT 201 and other second year statistics courses, but they are significantly different enough to not be credit excluded. STAT 201 covers topics not found in these courses that will be needed for STAT 301, including simulation-based inference and reproducible scripting for analysis.
