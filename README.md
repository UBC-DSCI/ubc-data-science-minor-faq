# UBC Data Science minor FAQ
Frequently asked question page for the [UBC Data Science minor](https://datascience.ubc.ca/minor).

*Formal approval for the Data Science Minor is pending. In anticipation of approval, we are moving forward with admissions at this time.*

I have filled out the application form for the Data Science Minor, is there anything else I should do? 
> Yes. Please make sure to complete any requirements for admission into a minor program from your home faculty. For example, the Faculty of Science students must fill out the form for [Science Minor: Minor in another Science specialization](https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9yOGsxLDg6FH6bH) by May 15th. 

The form my home Faculty requires me to fill in asks for the signature of the Minor advisor. How should I contact this person. 
> Note that students in the Faculty of Science do not need the minor advisor's signature yet. You can submit your application to the Faculty of Science with only the signature of your major advisor. We will contact the Faculty of Science directly after the admission process. We are in contact with the Faculty of Arts regarding this.  

I am currently a third-year student, but I will be gaining year four status in September. Can I still apply? 
> Probably! You need to satisfy the requirements for admission into a minor program from your home faculty. The Faculty Science, for example, allows second and third-year students to apply, even if they will be fourth-year students by the start of the program. 
(We are in touch with the Faculty of Arts and will post their requirements regarding this soon.)

I am a first-year student without a specialization. Can I apply?
> Depends on the restriction of your home faculty. Faculty of Science does not allow first-year students to apply to a minor. 

I am taking DSCI100 this summer term; what should I enter in the text field for "Grade in DSCI 100" in the application form?
> Great! You can write "taking the course in the summer" for this field. We hope you enjoy the course!  

I read that if the minor is oversubscribed, a randomization process will be used to select candidates. Will any of the criteria in this selection process be based on GPA? Is there anything I can do in my application to stand out?

> Thanks for your interest in the program. As long as you meet the minimum lower level requirements (listed on https://datascience.ubc.ca/minor), then you have the same chance getting into the minor as anyone else who meets those requirements. Our goal for the program is to make it accessible to all students who want to take the program and meet the admissions requirements. We may not be able to do this in the first couple of years of the program, due to resource limitations and program demand. If demand exceeds the spots we can make available (which are limited by our resources) that is when the randomization process will come into play. 

I havenâ€™t taken any of the lower-level course requirements for admission to the Data Science minor yet. Can I still apply and be accepted, contingent my grades being above 68% in those courses once I take them? 

> Thanks for your interest in the Data Science minor. You must have taken the lower-level requirements, and achieved the minimum GPA (listed here: https://datascience.ubc.ca/minor) in them to meet the criteria for admission into the Data Science minor by the start of winter term 1 (for this round of applications, this is September, 2021). We will consider applications for students who take the pre-requisites in the summer, and they may be accepted with the condition that a minimum grade of 68% in the Data Science Minor lower-level requirements is obtained before the start of winter term 1.

I am in third year standing now, but will be in 4th year standing in September, am I eligible for admission to the minor?

> Thanks for your interest in the Data Science minor. I am sorry, but it is not open to students with 4th year standing in the fall of the year they apply. We had to have the line drawn somewhere. If I was able to, I would make this program available to all students, however we have the reality of resources limiting the number of students it can support. Have you considered applying for one of the UBC Master of Data Science programs for your next degree? We have three programs, you can learn more about them here: https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/

Can I use a different second year statistics course in place of STAT 201 as the pre-requisite for STAT 301?

> To obtain the Data Science minor, you will be required to take STAT 301, and STAT 201 is a hard prerequisite for it. Thus, you will need to take STAT 201 if you want to complete the minor. There is some overlap between STAT 201 and other second year statistics courses, but they are significantly different enough to not be credit excluded. STAT 201 covers topics not found in these courses that will be needed for STAT 301, including simulation-based inference and reproducible scripting for analysis.
